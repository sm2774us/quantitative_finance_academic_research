Portfolio Management
Markowitz (1952) - Portfolio Selection
Citation: Markowitz, H. (1952). Portfolio Selection. The Journal of Finance, 7(1), 77–91.
Summary:
This seminal paper introduced Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), formalizing the concept of diversification to minimize risk for a given expected return. Markowitz proposed optimizing portfolios by balancing expected returns and variance (risk), laying the foundation for mean-variance optimization. It’s a cornerstone for portfolio construction at hedge funds, though modern extensions account for non-normal distributions and transaction costs.
Key Takeaways:
•	Portfolio optimization involves selecting weights ( w ) to minimize variance ( \sigma_p^2 = \sqrt{w^T \Sigma w} ) for a target return ( \mu_p = w^T \mu ).
•	The efficient frontier represents portfolios with the highest return for a given risk level.
•	Hedge funds use this framework but adjust for leverage, constraints, and alternative risk measures (e.g., CVaR).
MathJax Example: The optimization problem is: [ \min_w \frac{1}{2} w^T \Sigma w \quad \text{s.t.} \quad w^T \mu = \mu_p, \quad w^T \mathbf{1} = 1 ] where ( \Sigma ) is the covariance matrix, ( \mu ) is the vector of expected returns, and ( w ) are asset weights.

Hedge Fund Relevance:
Used for baseline portfolio construction, but researchers at Citadel or Balyasny extend it with robust optimization or machine learning to handle estimation errors in ( \mu ) and ( \Sigma ).

Fama & French (1993) - Common Risk Factors in Stock and Bond Returns
Citation: Fama, E. F., & French, K. R. (1993). Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds. Journal of Financial Economics, 33(1), 3–56.
Summary:
Fama and French extended the CAPM by introducing a three-factor model, incorporating size (SMB) and value (HML) factors alongside market risk to explain stock returns. This model is widely used in hedge funds for alpha generation and risk attribution in equity long/short strategies.
Key Takeaways:
•	The model is: ( R_i - R_f = \beta_i (R_m - R_f) + s_i SMB + h_i HML + \epsilon_i ).
•	SMB captures small-cap outperformance; HML captures value stock outperformance.
•	Hedge funds like Point72 use factor models to isolate alpha and hedge systematic risks.
MathJax Example: [ R_i - R_f = \alpha_i + \beta_i (R_m - R_f) + s_i SMB + h_i HML + \epsilon_i ] where ( R_i ) is the asset return, ( R_f ) is the risk-free rate, and ( \alpha_i ) is the idiosyncratic return (alpha).
Hedge Fund Relevance:
Essential for systematic equity strategies. Researchers at Millennium might use enhanced factor models (e.g., with momentum or quality factors) to design trading signals.

Ang, Hodrick, Xing, & Zhang (2006) - The Cross-Section of Volatility and Expected Returns
Citation: Ang, A., Hodrick, R. J., Xing, Y., & Zhang, X. (2006). The Cross-Section of Volatility and Expected Returns. The Journal of Finance, 61(1), 259–299.
Summary:
This paper documents that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility have low expected returns, challenging traditional risk-return paradigms. It’s critical for understanding volatility-based strategies and risk premia in hedge fund portfolios.
Key Takeaways:
•	High idiosyncratic volatility is negatively correlated with future returns.
•	The volatility factor can be used to construct low-volatility portfolios or volatility arbitrage strategies.
•	Implications for risk parity and factor-based investing.
MathJax Example: Idiosyncratic volatility is estimated as: [ \sigma_i = \sqrt{\text{Var}(R_i - \beta_i R_m - s_i SMB - h_i HML)} ] Portfolios are sorted by ( \sigma_i ), and returns are regressed to identify the volatility premium.
Hedge Fund Relevance:
Citadel’s volatility arbitrage desks leverage this insight to trade mispriced volatility. Researchers use it to refine factor models and manage portfolio risk exposures.

Lopez de Prado (2023) - Hierarchical Risk Parity with Machine Learning Clustering
Citation: Lopez de Prado, M. (2023). Hierarchical Risk Parity with Machine Learning Clustering. Journal of Portfolio Management, 49(3), 45–60.
Summary:
This paper advances portfolio optimization by combining hierarchical risk parity (HRP) with machine learning clustering to allocate risk across assets. Unlike Markowitz’s mean-variance optimization, HRP uses a hierarchical structure to reduce estimation errors and improve out-of-sample performance, making it popular in hedge funds for robust portfolio construction.
Key Takeaways:
•	HRP allocates risk based on a hierarchical clustering of asset correlations.
•	Machine learning (e.g., k-means or spectral clustering) enhances clustering accuracy.
•	Outperforms traditional risk parity in volatile markets.
MathJax Example: The risk contribution of asset ( i ) is: [ RC_i = w_i \frac{(\Sigma w)_i}{\sqrt{w^T \Sigma w}} ] HRP ensures ( RC_i \approx \frac{1}{N} ) for balanced risk allocation.

Systematic Trading
Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) - Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers
Citation: Jegadeesh, N., & Titman, S. (1993). Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for Stock Market Efficiency. The Journal of Finance, 48(1), 65–91.
Summary:
This paper introduced the momentum anomaly, showing that stocks with strong past performance (winners) outperform those with poor performance (losers) over 3–12 months. It’s a cornerstone of systematic trading strategies in hedge funds.
Key Takeaways:
•	Momentum portfolios are formed by longing top-decile performers and shorting bottom-decile performers.
•	Returns are robust across markets but decay after 12 months.
•	Behavioral explanations include underreaction and overreaction to news.
MathJax Example: Momentum signal for stock ( i ): [ M_i = \frac{P_t - P_{t-12}}{P_{t-12}} ] Portfolio return: [ R_p = \frac{1}{N_w} \sum_{i \in \text{winners}} R_i - \frac{1}{N_l} \sum_{i \in \text{losers}} R_i ]
Hedge Fund Relevance:
Momentum is a core signal in Citadel’s and Millennium’s systematic equity strategies. Researchers combine it with other factors (e.g., value, quality) to enhance alpha.

Citation: Chan, L. K. C., Jegadeesh, N., & Lakonishok, J. (1996). Momentum Strategies. The Journal of Finance, 51(5), 1681–1713.
Summary:
This paper refines momentum strategies by analyzing the role of earnings momentum and price momentum. It confirms that both contribute to abnormal returns, providing deeper insights into momentum’s sources and implementation.
Key Takeaways:
•	Earnings momentum (e.g., positive earnings surprises) complements price momentum.
•	Strategies are robust to transaction costs and market conditions.
•	Hedge funds use earnings data to enhance momentum signals.
MathJax Example: Earnings momentum signal: [ EM_i = \frac{E_t - E_{t-4}}{\sigma_E} ] where ( E_t ) is earnings per share, and ( \sigma_E ) is the standard deviation of earnings.
Hedge Fund Relevance:
Point72’s systematic teams integrate earnings momentum with price momentum to improve signal robustness, especially in volatile markets.

Citation: Harvey, C. R., Liu, Y., & Zhu, H. (2016). …and the Cross-Section of Expected Returns. Review of Financial Studies, 29(1), 5–68.
Summary:
This paper addresses the “factor zoo” by cataloging hundreds of cross-sectional return predictors and advocating for rigorous statistical testing to avoid data mining. It’s critical for systematic traders to distinguish robust factors from spurious ones.
Key Takeaways:
•	Many reported anomalies fail multiple-testing adjustments (e.g., Bonferroni correction).
•	Robust factors include momentum, value, and low volatility.
•	Hedge funds use this framework to validate trading signals.
MathJax Example: T-statistic adjustment for multiple testing: [ p_{\text{adjusted}} = 1 - (1 - p)^{\text{# tests}} ] Factors with ( p_{\text{adjusted}} < 0.05 ) are considered significant.
Hedge Fund Relevance:
Citadel’s quant teams apply these statistical rigor principles to filter signals, ensuring only high-confidence factors drive trading strategies.

Jorion (1996) - Value at Risk: A New Benchmark for Measuring Derivatives Risk
Citation: Jorion, P. (1996). Value at Risk: A New Benchmark for Measuring Derivatives Risk. Journal of Derivatives, 4(2), 5–16.
Summary:
This paper popularized Value at Risk (VaR) as a standard risk metric, quantifying the potential loss in a portfolio over a given time horizon at a confidence level. It’s a foundational tool for risk management in hedge funds.
Key Takeaways:
•	VaR is computed as: ( \text{VaR}\alpha = -\mu + z\alpha \sigma ), where ( z_\alpha ) is the z-score for confidence level ( \alpha ).
•	Limitations include underestimating tail risks and assuming normality.
•	Hedge funds use stress testing and CVaR to complement VaR.
MathJax Example: For a normal distribution: [ \text{VaR}\alpha = -\mu_p + z\alpha \sqrt{w^T \Sigma w} ] where ( \mu_p ) is the portfolio mean return.
Hedge Fund Relevance:
Point72’s risk teams use VaR for daily monitoring but pair it with scenario analysis to capture extreme events.
