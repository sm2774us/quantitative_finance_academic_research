## Summary:
This paper refines momentum strategies by analyzing the role of earnings momentum and price momentum. It confirms that both contribute to abnormal returns, providing deeper insights into momentum’s sources and implementation.

## Key Takeaways:
- Earnings momentum (e.g., positive earnings surprises) complements price momentum.
- Strategies are robust to transaction costs and market conditions.
- Hedge funds use earnings data to enhance momentum signals.

## MathJax Example:
Earnings momentum signal:

$$
EM_i = \frac{E_t - E_{t-4}}{\sigma_E}
$$

where,
- $E_t$ is earnings per share, and
- $\sigma_E$ is the standard deviation of earnings.

## Hedge Fund Relevance:
Point72’s systematic teams integrate earnings momentum with price momentum to improve signal robustness, especially in volatile markets.
