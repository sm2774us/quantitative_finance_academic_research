## Summary:
This paper documents that stocks with high idiosyncratic volatility have low expected returns, challenging traditional risk-return paradigms. It’s critical for understanding volatility-based strategies and risk premia in hedge fund portfolios.

## Key Takeaways:
- High idiosyncratic volatility is negatively correlated with future returns.
- The volatility factor can be used to construct low-volatility portfolios or volatility arbitrage strategies.
- Implications for risk parity and factor-based investing.

## MathJax Example:

Idiosyncratic volatility is estimated as:

$$
\sigma_i = \sqrt{\text{Var}(R_i - \beta_i R_m - s_i SMB - h_i HML)}
$$

Portfolios are sorted by $\sigma_i$, and returns are regressed to identify the volatility premium.

## Hedge Fund Relevance:
Citadel’s volatility arbitrage desks leverage this insight to trade mispriced volatility. Researchers use it to refine factor models and manage portfolio risk exposures.
